<h1><font color = "white">Who are we and what is this about?</font></h1>
<p><font color = "white">We are a team of university students. Our main reason for making this site is
to help people get fit. As we all know there are a lot of people, who would want to be in great physical shape
and are willing to exercise, but don't know how to train properly. So we decided to help them by making a site where
everyone can have his individual fitness program and health diet made by us. The most important thing about are programs
is that they are based on BIO products. That way you will not only look good, but also feel good and be healthy.</font></p>
